# Roblox
 All of my works I have created for Roblox, whether that be for personal projects, testing places, or fully-fledged games. Works made in teams may not appear here due to me not holding control over the team.


# Licensing
My works are licensed under a custom license I wrote myself. Don't worry, however, as I will go over the license in simpler terms here.

### Distribution
Any type of distribution must include a link to my github page (https://github.com/BlockateBuilder), unless I say otherwise.

### Non-Commercial Use
My work, or any work derived from it, are not to be used commercially without permission from me

### Commercial Use Conditions
When distributing my works commercially, I must receive an agreed upon cut of profit.
My work must not be the primary focus of the product you are selling (e.g. it cannot be sold as-is or as the main feature)

### No Warranty
My work is provided 'as-is' without any warranty,
meaning in no event shall I be liable for claim, damages,
or any other type of liability.

By using, modifying or distributing my work, you agree to the terms stated above.
